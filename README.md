 > ## Team Profile Generator is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user will be prompted with a bunch of questions bassed off of what employee role you are filling out, manager, engineer or intern. This project uses Jest for testing and Node.js.
